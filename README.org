* Notre Dame CRC Wiki

This wiki is organized using [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYip_Vuv8J0][2 levels]] of increasing complexity. This page details the need to know. The [[file:./ADVANCED.org][advanced]] wiki has a much more in-depth discussion of what is required. The purpose of this wiki is to explain to users specifically in [[https://psychology.nd.edu/graduate-programs/areas-of-study/quantitative/][Quant Psych]] how they can use the CRC to further their research using distributed and parallel computing. The programming language of choice will be [[https://www.r-project.org/][R]], but the techniques described within are expected to be broadly applicable across technologies.
The crc utilizes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univa_Grid_Engine][Univa Grid Engine]] as it's batch queing system, and this wiki is a dedicated resource to learning how to operate within that environment.

Official stance of Notre Dame on Linux Users:

However, in practice, using the CRC as a Linux user is in fact easier than all other platforms, if only because you are already used to the command line. 

*** Getting familiar with the command line
**** Transfering files to and from the crc
You can use the command scp to send files to the crc


How to transfer a single file:
#+NAME: Transfering a single file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  scp ~/PATH/TO/FILE/file.txt user@fontendmachine.crc.nd.edu:~/PATH/TO/DIR/
#+END_SRC

How to transfer a folder:
#+NAME: Transfering a folder
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  scp -r ~/PATH/TO/DIR user@fontendmachine.crc.nd.edu:~/PATH/TO/DIR/
#+END_SRC

In both instances you will be prompted for your password.
